### Intro to CI/CD Workshop

## Getting started
We will be using Travis-CI and Coveralls in order to create a continuous integration pipeline. Travis-CI will run our tests immediately after a branch is updated. Coveralls will also run during this process as well, giving us an updated code coverage report.
